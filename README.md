# C-NC-DNA-sequence-detecting-using-Machine-Learning
Detecting coding / noncoding DNA sequences ( after convert to CGR (Chaos_game_representation) images) using four different Machine learning algorithms 
--------------
Datasets:
Training data from 10 mammalian species(40 coding sequence and 40 non coding intron parts), gene names: CSN1S1, IL2, LCE6A and SMCP
Testing data from 10 mammalian species(20 coding sequence and 20 non coding intron parts), gene names: STK11 and TP53
-----------------
So in this project we try use four algorithms and then choose best one :
Naive Bayes algorithm
Logistic Regression algorithm
K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm
Perceptron algorithm 
---------------------
 conclusion, from point 1 and 2 , this project conclude logistic regression then Perceptron ( supervised learning, linear classifier ) is the best model for detecting coding DNA sequences from noncoding DNA sequences using chaos game representation approach. may be because the logistic regression & perceptron is an algorithms for learning a binary classifier, and gradient descent to reach best decision boundary.
